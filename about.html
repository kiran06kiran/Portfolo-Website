    <h1 class="heading"> About <span>me</span> </h1>
    <p>My name is Kirandeep Kaur. I am a resident of Gurdaspur, Punjab. I am pursuing Bsc Hons Mathematics from Lovely Professional University. Recently I have completed two internships. One as a Market Researcher from TESCOM Business Solutions where I have to collect the information of given companies by applying Search Engine Optimization techniques and research the companies by using various social media platforms and then connecting up with their CEOs and Directors to provide the best business solutions for their company. And the second one is Content writer where I have to coordinate, created and scheduled content, design and periodic updates to the company website. I have worked there with over 5-10 employees to gather and define the company's feed. The key skill I have learnt in this internship was creative writing and business communication. Also, I have done two projects based on the python programming language. The first one is a car racing game project and the second is a space invaders project. These are the desktop application that I have developed in the Python platform. In these projects, I have used while loops, for loops, built-in as well as user-defined functions, used three libraries time, random, Pygame and math library. These projects were very informative and helped me to learn various functions and libraries of Python. My short term goal is to complete my graduation. I am self-motivated and hardworking with a positive attitude toward my goal. My long term goal is to get a good position in a reputed company as a Programmer Analyst. My skill set includes R Programming language, C programming language, Python Programming Language, MS Excel, and Data Analysis. Apart from my education, I am always interested in knowing new things. I have done some certification courses like C Programming Language and MS Excel. I have actively participated in workshops, webinars and seminars which help me to gain some additional knowledge. Talking about my role model, to be honest, instead of looking for role models, I try to become one. I would love to be an inspiration for people around me, and people at work.
